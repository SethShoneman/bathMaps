# Overview
This is a simple version of an idea for an application which allows users to locate bathrooms in their current area, most likely for use in a city.

## Files
### plotlyExpress.py
This is the actual python file which should be run, and will generate a iterance of a map, with some example points plotted. When hovered over, these points will display information about the location. A option to review them will also appear, but is currently unusable.
### plotlyBackup.py
This file, when run, will result in the same output as the plotlyExpress program, however it will not include hover or review placement capabilities. This was used in development for retaining the original code for use, in case a change made resulted in unwanted results.
### repository.py
Here, the different example points are stored as objects of the location class, and can be accessed for their respective characteristics from the plotly files.
